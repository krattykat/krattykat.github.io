    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Mara Patrick (he/they pronouns) and I've been coding for three months now. <br> I initally began to code when I was fifteen years old, making lyrical webpages for my personal enjoyment using the most basic HTML I could find through Google and W3Schools. <br> Now I'm pursuing a Computer Science associate's degree at Georgia State's Perimeter College with the intent to transfer to either Georgia State's main campus or Georgia Tech (if I happen to be so lucky, lol). <br> I genuinely enjoy coding and I can't wait to fully embark on this career path!</p>
