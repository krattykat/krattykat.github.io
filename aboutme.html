    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Hello, My Name is Mara!</h2>
    <p>I've been coding for three months now, but I initally began to code when I was fifteen years old, making lyrical webpages for my personal enjoyment using the most basic HTML I could find through Google and W3Schools.
        <br> Now, I am pursuing a Computer Science associate's degree at Georgia State's Perimeter College with the intent to transfer to either Georgia State's main campus or Georgia Tech (god bless me). 
        <br> I genuinely enjoy coding and I can't wait to fully embark on this career path!</p>
